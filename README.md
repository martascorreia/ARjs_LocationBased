Test application of AR.js, in the scope of my thesis "Web Augmented Reality Applied to Cultural Heritage". 
This project tests the use of geolocation as the tracking method for the Augmented Reality experience. Consult AR.js at "[https://ar-js-org.github.io/AR.js-Docs/marker-based/](https://ar-js-org.github.io/AR.js-Docs/location-based/)" for documentation.

Location-based tracking is a sensor-based technique that utilizes geolocation sensors to communicate with Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites, thereby determining the deviceâ€™s location. Furthermore, by knowing both the location of the device and a fixed
reference point, this method is also able to calculate the distance between the two. This method has the disadvantage of being prone to precision errors. However, it is a very affordable and fast method that is integrated into most mobile devices.

The see the project working:
1. access "https://martascorreia.github.io/ARjs_LocationBased/";
2. move the camera around, and find the yellow cube.

Test application of the framework AR, in the scope of my thesis "Web Augmented Reality Applied to Cultural Heritage". 
This project tests the use of geolocation as the tracking method for the Augmented Reality experience. Consult AR.js at "[https://ar-js-org.github.io/AR.js-Docs/marker-based/](https://ar-js-org.github.io/AR.js-Docs/location-based/)" for documentation.

The working project can be accessed at "https://martascorreia.github.io/ARjs_LocationBased/".
